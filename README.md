I just wanted a silly Minesweeper game for my own Discord profile and couldn't find a simple generator that did it right. It needed to use spoiler tags and, most importantly, fit under the 190-character limit which was always tempermental using other generators

So I made this.

## Features

-   Generates a random Minesweeper board.
-   Automatically formatted for Discord with spoiler tags (`||...||`).
-   Will to be under the 190-character limit for profiles.
-   One-click "Copy to Clipboard" button for convenience.
-   Looks clean and is super easy to use.

## How to Use

1.  Go to the live site.
2.  Click the **`Generate`** button.
3.  Hit **`Copy to Clipboard`**.
4.  Paste it into your Discord "about me" section in your profile settings. Done!
